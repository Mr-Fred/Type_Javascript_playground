# Unspooled: A Movie Search Engine powered by AI.

Unspooled is a web application that allows users to search for and discover movies. It's started following [Freecodecamp tutorial](https://replit.com/@TomiTokko/MoviesApp) on learning basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it uses the `TMDb API` to fetch movie data.

I am extending the app into a full web App where Users can simply enter a search query into the search bar, and the app will return a list of matching movies. Each movie is displayed as a card, which includes the movie's title, poster image, and release date.

## Future Development

  1. Users can click on a movie card to view more information about the movie. 
  2. If logged-In/Sign-up, They can also add movies to their watchlist or mark them as favorites.
  3. Users can get movie summary generated from AI. It will be a valuable resource for movie buffs who want to learn more about the films they love.
  4. Users can filter by Category
  5. Unspooled home page will be divided into 5 sections: Last week's releases, This Week's releases, Next week's release's, Top Trending and Most Watched.
